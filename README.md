# Now Zero-Config API with NextJS API Routes

## How to use

### Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamgruber/now-api-test.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Deploy to Now

Deploy it to the cloud with [now](https://zeit.co/now) ([download](https://zeit.co/download))

```bash
now
```

## The idea behind the example

Now provides a [zero-config](https://zeit.co/guides/upgrade-to-zero-configuration#with-zero-configuration) option for setting up an API. Next.js ships with [API routes](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#api-routes), which provide an easy solution to build your own `API`. Using the two together produces an unexpected result.
